I am an assistant professor at [University of Toulouse 1 Capitole](https://www.ut-capitole.fr/){:target="\_blank"} and a faculty member of the [Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse (IAST)](https://www.iast.fr/){:target="\_blank"},
where I lead the [Social Evolution team](https://www.iast.fr/social-evolution), and co-organize (with [Péter Bayer](https://www.sites.google.com/view/peterbayer){:target="\_blank"}) the [Evolutionary Models and Applications Group (EMAG)](https://emag-iast.github.io){:target="\_blank"} and (with [Victor Gay](https://sites.google.com/site/victorgayeco/){:target="\_blank"}) the [Toulouse Summer School in Quantitative Social Sciences](https://www.iast.fr/toulouse-summer-school-quantitative-social-sciences){:target="\_blank"}.

I am interested in mathematical models of cooperation and conflict. My research focuses on different aspects of [social evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_evolution){:target="\_blank"} and [collective action problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem){:target="\_blank"}, and their [mathematical modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model){:target="\_blank"} using a variety of approaches, including
[evolutionary game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory){:target="\_blank"}
and
[adaptive dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_invasion_analysis){:target="\_blank"}.

I teach at the [Toulouse School Economics (TSE)](https://www.tse-fr.eu/){:target="\_blank"}'s [Master in Economics and Ecology](https://www.tse-fr.eu/master-economics-and-ecology){:target="\_blank"} and at the TSE/IAST's [Toulouse Summer School in Quantitative Social Sciences](https://www.iast.fr/toulouse-summer-school-quantitative-social-sciences){:target="\_blank"}.

Here is a copy of my [CV](https://jorgeapenas.github.io/assets/pdf/cv_jorgepena.pdf){:target="\_blank"}.
