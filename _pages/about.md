I am an assistant professor at [University of Toulouse 1 Capitole](https://www.ut-capitole.fr/){:target="\_blank"} and a faculty member of the [Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse (IAST)](https://www.iast.fr/){:target="\_blank"}. I will be on leave during the academic year 2022-2023, as IAS fellow at the [Institute for Advanced Study (IAS)](https://ias.uva.nl/){:target="\_blank"} of the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en){:target="\_blank"} (September 2022 - February 2023) and as visitor at the [Department of Human Behavior, Ecology and Culture](https://www.eva.mpg.de/ecology/){:target="\_blank"} of the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology](https://www.eva.mpg.de/){:target="\_blank"} (March 2023 - July 2023).

I am interested in mathematical models of cooperation and conflict. My research focuses on different aspects of [social evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_evolution){:target="\_blank"} and [collective action problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem){:target="\_blank"}, and their [mathematical modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model){:target="\_blank"} using [evolutionary game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory){:target="\_blank"}
and related approaches at the intersection of theoretical biology and economics.

I teach at the [Toulouse School Economics (TSE)](https://www.tse-fr.eu/){:target="\_blank"}'s [Master in Economics and Ecology](https://www.tse-fr.eu/master-economics-and-ecology){:target="\_blank"}, at the [University of Toulouse 3 Paul Sabatier]([https://www.tse-fr.eu/](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/)){:target="\_blank"}'s [Master Ecologie et Evolution]([https://www.tse-fr.eu/master-economics-and-ecology](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/master-parcours-ecologie-evolution-ecoevo)){:target="\_blank"} and at the TSE/IAST's [Toulouse Summer School in Quantitative Social Sciences](https://www.iast.fr/toulouse-summer-school-quantitative-social-sciences){:target="\_blank"}.

Here is a copy of my [CV](https://jorgeapenas.github.io/assets/pdf/cv_jorgepena.pdf){:target="\_blank"}.
